# -Predicting-Mortality-in-Liver-Cirrhosis-Patients-Using-Machine-Learning
This project investigates the predictive capacity of three machine learning models — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost — in forecasting mortality among patients with liver cirrhosis. The goal is to support early clinical decision-making by identifying high-risk patients using structured clinical data.
